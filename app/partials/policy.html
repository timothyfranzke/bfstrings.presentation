        <p>Shipping is not included and will be added to the purchase price of the instrument
            All orders and payments should include your name, street address, telephone number, instrument inventory number, and any special delivery instructions. We ship by UPS Ground (insured) unless another means of shipping is requested.   We do not ship instruments by mail, and we cannot ship to APO or FPO addresses. Instruments must have a signature. If no one home will be home to accept a package during business hours, we suggest you have your instrument sent to your business address or to a friend who will be at home.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Partial payment: A deposit of 25% of the price of an instrument will hold an instrument, with the balance due in full in 30 days. Deposits are non-refundable and instruments are not returnable when payment is made this way. Credit cards are not accepted for deposits.</li>
    <li>Your instrument will be shipped when payment in full is received. If we expect any delay in shipping, we will try to let you know when you place your order. Generally instruments are shipped the day of receipt of payment unless payment is made by check.</li>
    <li>Returns:  Unless the instrument, when received, is not the instrument you ordered or is materially defective in workmanship or materials, you are responsible for shipping and insurance to return. We reserve the right to make the final decision as to whether a returned instrument is in fact materially defective in workmanship or materials. If we determine that an instrument is materially defective in workmanship or materials, we will remit all costs of shipping and insurance both ways. When you receive your instrument you have 48 hours to examine it. If you are not satisfied, call us immediately to let us know it is being returned. Your only option is to return the instrument if you are not satisfied with the condition of the instrument unless you contact us within 48 hours and we mutually agree to some other option such as you having the instrument repaired locally. You will be given an authorization number to write on the carton, and we will expect to receive the refused instrument in a timely manner.
        We will refund the price of the instrument as soon as it arrives at our facility in the condition it left our shop. You are responsible for the cost of freight both ways. All returns require that the instrument be in the same condition as when it left our shop. If your transaction involves a trade, and you reject the instrument we send you, we have the choice either to return your trade instrument or refund the cash value allowed for it in the trade deal. Unless otherwise agreed, you the customer are responsible for all risk of loss or damage in shipping so insurance is a must. There is no approval period for new instruments, as they are warranted by the manufacturer. All our shipments are insured and any return shipment must also be insured.</li>
