    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <h5>Glenn Bradford</h5>
    <h6>Chief Thinker-Upper</h6>

    <p>Glenn Bradford was born and raised in and around Nashville, Tennessee. He developed an interest in bluegrass music and the five string
        banjo in 1975 while serving in the US Air Force at Kansas City, Missouri. That interest later led him to take up the mandolin and acoustic guitar.
        Over the years Glenn developed an interest in buying and selling fine mandolins and guitars. As a fan, a player, and a collector, Glenn over
        time developed a great appreciation for high quality stringed instruments and for the talented luthiers who build them.
        A trial lawyer by trade, Glenn practiced in private practice in Kansas City for 40 years. Upon reaching the stage of life where many people retire,
        Glenn made the decision to retire from the law and go into business with Mr.  Franzke to indulge his passion for music and musical instruments on a
        full time basis. Glenn describes his role in the partnership as handling the business side of the enterprise and taking as much of the burden of
        running the business as possible off Mr. Franzke, so that he can focus on what he does best, building high quality banjos, mandolins, and guitars.
        Glenn also plays the role of "Chief Thinker Upper," conceiving and figuring how to make Bradford & Franzke's products more appealing to players
        and their services more efficient.</p>

    <h5>Mark Franzke</h5>
    <h6>Artist/Luthier</h6>

    <p>Mark built his first mandolin in 1978 while a Fine Arts student at the University of Kansas. After graduation, he began a career in graphic design, illustration, and concept and product development. He also continued developing his woodworking skills, building a few banjos.
        In 2005, Mark decided to focus more seriously on mandolin building under the name "Flinthills Mandolins." After several requests from customers for mandolins with Mark's signature in place of the Flinthills logo, Mark decided to replace the Flinthills name with "Franzke" to emphasize that each instrument is hand crafted by an individual luthier, not mass produced in a factory setting.
        Mark loves the details and artistry of the instrument, and each one is a unique artistic expression based on the whims of the artist and desires of the customer.
        Mark handles repair and supervises construction of the Hawthorn instruments as well as making custom instruments for customers.</p>
